# Coding exercise: tetris from scratch without seeing any reference implementations

I've never programmed a tetris game before, so I wanted to try how long it would take from me to code one from scratch, without seeing any reference implementation, stack overflow or anything else beside javadoc.

I finished the project in a bit over three hours and the only think I had to look up from google was how to setup a JPanel for draw canvas and input reading (see the Example.java for these).
